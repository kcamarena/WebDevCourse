This website is hosted on Amazon AWS and contains the "order page" assignment with Javascript, CSS using the Adobe Color wheel, Bootstrap, and limited JQuery. I was able to get the quantity drop down menu to tie in mathematically to the tax, sub-total, and total lines dynamically.  To exclude a line item, choose quantity 0.  

I added links to the assigned resume in Bootstrap, but was unable to load the database to the previously constructed WP website to this live link, though it is in the git repository for HW 4. I added a custom Google search bar to the top of the page that only searches the web sites that I've listed. 

Though I followed the Amazon tutorial to link the DNS with the IP address and the account appears to show them as linked, http://sun2chem.org and http://34.197.67.161 (Wordpress) are not the same page. The Wordpress link is included in my sun2che.org website using the minimaze WP theme, but I was unable to get my previously created WP site from Class 4 to populate.  Did not have time to fully recreate this website after trouble-shooting failed for uploading the previously created databse.
